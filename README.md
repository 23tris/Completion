# Completion Project
A website built using HTML and CSS skills which includes custom images, layout, and styling. The project also focusses on using the slider and basic elements to make the page responsive. Implemented a responsive menu that collapses when faced in the  mobile dimensions.

Challenged Faced:
Making it responsive with every aspect ratio was the most challenging. Because I started doing it thinking that I was done with the formatting early on. Only to be faced with me redoing it after adding the slider and other features in.
